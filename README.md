# amazon_food_reviews
Online food reviews are a great source of information for consumers. From the sellers’ point of view, online reviews can be used to gauge the consumers’ feedback on the products or services they are selling. However, since these online reviews are quite often overwhelming in terms of numbers and information, an intelligent system, capable of finding key insights (topics) from these reviews, will be of great help for both the consumers and the sellers. This system will serve two purposes:
Enable consumers to quickly extract the key topics covered by the reviews without having to go through all of them
Help the sellers/retailers get consumer feedback in the form of topics (extracted from the consumer reviews)
